 üîí Arduino Alpha Board Security System ‚Äî Intrusion Detection

This project implements an effective security system using the Arduino Alpha Board. It features intrusion detection based on light and temperature sensors, status LEDs, a buzzer, and manual arm/disarm buttons. The system detects abnormal environmental conditions and triggers both visual and audio alerts.

 LED (Red)                Indicates the system is **armed**                                    
 LED (Green)              Indicates the system is **disarmed**                                 
 LED (Yellow)             Signals active surveillance and alerts                               
 Buzzer                   Sounds in both **armed** and **alert** states                        
 Light Sensor (LDR)       Detects ambient light level                                          
 Temperature Sensor       Detects environmental temperature

 IR Transmitter/Receiver  Reserved for future intrusion detection using beam break or motion logic 



 üö¶ System Behavior

 ‚úÖ Armed

 Triggered when:
Arm button is pressed (`analogRead ‚âà 1023`)
Ambient light is low (value ‚â§ `LIGHT_THRESHOLD`)
 System enters active surveillance mode:

Red LED turns ON
Yellow LED turns ON
 Buzzer is activated
 Sensor readings are continuously monitored.


 ‚ùå Disarmed
Triggered when:

  Disarm button is pressed
  OR Arm button is not pressed
  Green LED turns ON
Red, Yellow LEDs and buzzer are OFF
 Sensor input is ignored.

 ‚ö†Ô∏è Alert / Intrusion Detection

Active only while the system is armed, and:

  Light level rises above `LIGHT_THRESHOLD` (e.g., flashlight intrusion)
  Temperature drops below `TEMP_THRESHOLD` (environmental anomaly)
  Yellow LED blinks
Buzzer pulses to signal an alert condition



 üîß Thresholds & Calibration

Tune the system sensitivity using these constants:


const int LIGHT_THRESHOLD = 100;  // Lower = more sensitive to brightness
const int TEMP_THRESHOLD  = 500;  // Lower = more tolerant to cold


 üìè Calibration Steps

1. Upload the code and open the Serial Monitor.
2. Record values of `lightVal` and `tempVal` under:

 Normal (safe) conditions
 Alert-triggering (e.g., bright light, cold air) conditions
3. Adjust the thresholds:

 Increase `LIGHT_THRESHOLD` to reduce sensitivity to ambient light.
 Decrease `TEMP_THRESHOLD` to avoid false alarms in cooler environments.

 Example:

If `lightVal` reads \~150 normally and \~500 with a flashlight:

cpp
const int LIGHT_THRESHOLD = 400;
